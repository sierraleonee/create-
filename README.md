<h1 style="color:Crimson;">Writing</h1>

<p> I'm not a very talkative person, my dad says it's probably because i'm shy around other people and mom and doctor says it might be (social) anxiety. 

  
  It started after school started back and my sister started highschool, my eighth grade year was pure chaos. I didn't like going to school and would do anything to get out of it because I didn't have friends or anybody to talk to.
  So i went back virtual and that seemed to make it worse because the teachers wanted us to turn our cameras on, like our gym teacher would make us turn our camera on or we would be marked absent, or
  our math teacher would make us speak when we could just text in the chat. When i'm around people I know like my close family and friends, I can talk up a storm, my sister thinks thats a problem.
  
  I took comfort in writing because
  its much easier then talking out loud. Sometimes when i'm bored i'll write a short story but I never finish them. My favorite thing is to write essays, especially
  when I know that I have a specific topic to write about because it's so fun to do. Sometimes I also correct my friends when they use incorrect grammer like when 
  talking about someone they'll use 'there' instead of 'their' or when they're talking about going somewhere they'll use 'too' instead of 'to' and I have to fight the urge to correct them. I'm not the best speller but I do know my puncuation.
